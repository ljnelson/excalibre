## Warnings

If you are looking for a model Python repository, _this is not it_.

If you are looking for a model Dockerfile, this repository does not
contain one.

## Repository Structure

Since I am new to all this, I have structured my repository following
the [Hitchhiker's Guide to Python recommendations][0].
